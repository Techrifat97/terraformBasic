There are  different modes we can put variables!

1. Interactive mode:

If we dont put the value for the variables and we use terraform apply command it will prompt a field for putting values.

2. Command line flags:

if we use terraform appply command then we use -var, we can provide the value with variable name.
example: terraform apply -var "filename = text.txt" -var "length = 2" 

3. Environment variable

we can use the variable values in the form of Environment variables:
such as $export TF_VAR_filename =" text.txt" then we can use the apply command

4. variable defination files

we can create a separte file containing values for the variables.
 NOTE that, they need to have the extension of the file either terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json
 or anyname.auto.tfvars or anyname.auto.tfvars.json

 even if a situation arises: where we use four different type of mode for variable value assign process there is a presedence:
 if we provide the varaiables with terraform apply -var "filename = text.txt", it will work first no matter which other we used. then comes variable 
 defination files and env varaiables.
